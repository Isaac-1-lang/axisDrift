# 2D Joystick Character Control

This project demonstrates how to control a 2D character using a joystick with Arduino. The code is written in an `.ino` file and is intended for microcontroller platforms.

## Features
- **Intuitive Controls:** Smooth and responsive character movement for a natural gameplay experience.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable code structure for adding new features or levels.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works with various Arduino boards and joystick modules.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear instructions and code comments for easy setup and modification.
- **Joystick Input:** Reads analog values from a joystick.
- **Character Movement:** Moves a character on a 2D grid based on joystick input.
- **Level System:** Supports multiple levels with increasing difficulty and new features.
- **Additional Features:**
    - Obstacles and boundaries
    - Score tracking
    - Power-ups
    - Sound effects
    - LED feedback

## Getting Started

1. **Connect the Joystick:** Wire the joystick to the Arduino as described in the code comments.
2. **Upload the Code:** Open `index.ino` in Arduino IDE and upload to your board.
3. **Play:** Use the joystick to move the character and progress through levels.

## Customization

- Add new levels by creating additional files in the  directory.
- Modify features or add new ones in the  folder.
